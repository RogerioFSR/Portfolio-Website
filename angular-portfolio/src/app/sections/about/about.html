          I'm a portuguese IT enthusiast with an academic background in Software and Networks Engineering. I've always worked with Object Oriented Programming Languages
          such as Python, Java, C#, C++ and Javascript, however I always use some of my free time to learn new languages, frameworks and technologies.
          I also love working in Machine Learning and Computer Vision challenges, with a strong focus on automation and efficiency improvement.
          In addition to that, I have experience working in marketing settings, customer handling and aquisition as well as team management and leadership.

          On a more personal note, I love cars and everything related to them: mechanics, technology and motorsports (F1 is my favorite sport). 
          I love playing video games as well, especially competitive games as those bring out the best in me when it comes to focus, determination and commitment.

          Due to the way I am, idle time is something I hate, which in turn has led me to develop strong time management and multitasking skills, as well
          as the ability to quickly find new objectives and challenges to keep me busy and motivated.

          If I was ever given a wish, I would wish for sleep to be optional, as I strongly believe that time is the most precious resource we have.
